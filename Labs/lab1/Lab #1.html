        <p>Hello! My name is Nabil Fayak, and I am currently a freshmen in college. I am taking this Micro-Credential because it's a great oppurtunity for me to develop some meaningful skills in web-development, and grow my portfolio to have relevant projects. I hope to especially grow my github, as currently it's pretty scarce. I was introduced to this program by a friend who had taken a previous CUNY Micro-Credentials course as well, and he said it was a phenomenal growing experience, with a chance to also meet various cool people. I hope to work well with everyone in the program and am looking forward to the class as a whole.</p>
