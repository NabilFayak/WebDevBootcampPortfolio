        <p id="collections">This program was a very fun experience, where I was able to learn every day and experiment with many things I'd never done before. A couple weeks ago I didn't know the slightest thing about Javascript nor CSS either. I was already familiar with HTML, however it was never to a great extent. Throughout this course, I feel as if I became proficient at HTML and CSS and became very familiar with Javascript. Learning the fundamentals of Python was a new experience as well. With this knowledge in hand, I can now seek out opportunities to fully apply my skills in a professional work environment. Not only did I gain knowledge and experience, but I also had the chance to gain some friends. My classmates are all wonderful ambitious people, seeking out what will better them and take them to another level. Being surrounded by these people in this learning space was a very fruitful endeavor as it pushed me to work as hard I could and make the most of this opportunity. I only wish the best for everyone that was a part of this experience with me, and hope that everyone lands a bigger and better opportunity in the future. This program was a great time and I can only hope to keep bettering myself with programs like this, in the future.</p>
